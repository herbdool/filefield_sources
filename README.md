# FileField Sources

FileField Sources is a module that enhances the generic and image upload fields
in Backdrop. Typically such fields only allow you to upload a file from your
desktop. FileField Sources makes it so that you can populate any file field from
a variety of sources, such as entering remote URLs directly, re-use existing
uploaded files, pull from a server directory, or a variety of other
possibilities.

## Installation

1. Install and enable this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions
   at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
2. Add or configure an existing file or image field.
  * To configure a typical node field, visit Admin -> Structure -> Content types
    and click "Manage fields" on a type you'd like to modify. Add a new file or
    image field or edit an existing one.
  * While editing the file or image field, you'll have new options available
    under a "File sources" fieldset. You can enable the desired sources for that
    particular field.
3. Create a piece of content that uses your file and try it out.
